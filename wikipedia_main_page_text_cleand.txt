founding

edit

the development of the github platform began on october









the site was launched in april by
tom prestonwerner

chris wanstrath

p j hyett
and scott chacon after it had been available for a few months as a
beta release




its name was chosen as a compound of
git
and
hub




structure of the organization

edit

github inc was originally a
flat organization
with no middle managers instead relying on
selfmanagement




employees could choose to work on projects that interested them
open allocation
but the chief executive set salaries



in the company added a layer of
middle management
in response to harassment allegations against its cofounder and thenceo thomas prestonwerner and his wife theresa prestonwerner as a result of the scandal
tom prestonwerner
resigned from his position as ceo



cofounder and product lead
chris wanstrath
became ceo
julio avalos
then general counsel and administrative officer assumed control over githubs business operations and daytoday management



finance

edit

github was a
bootstrapped
startup business
which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees



in july four years after the company was founded
andreessen horowitz
invested million in
venture capital



with a million valuation



in july github raised another million million in of venture capital in a
series b round
the lead investor was
sequoia capital
and other investors were
andreessen horowitz

thrive capital
ivp institutional venture partners and other venture capital funds






the company was then valued at approximately billion



as of

github was estimated to generate billion in revenue annually



history

edit

the github service was developed by
chris wanstrath

p j hyett

tom prestonwerner
and scott chacon using
ruby on rails
and started in february the company github inc was formed in and is located in san francisco



github at aws summit
the shading of the map illustrates the number of users as a proportion of each countrys
internet population
the circular charts surrounding the two hemispheres depict the total number of github users left and commits right per country
on february github announced that within the first year of being online github had accumulated over public repositories of which were formed in the previous month at that time about repositories had been
forked
at least once and had been merged
that same year the site was used by over users according to github



and had grown to host unique public repositories having been forked at least once for a total of repositories



in github was hosting million repositories



a year later this number doubled



readwriteweb
reported that github had surpassed
sourceforge
and
google code
in total number of commits for the period of january to may



on january github passed the million users mark and was then hosting more than million repositories



by the end of the year the number of repositories was twice as great reaching million repositories



in github opened an office in japan its first outside of the us



on february github fell victim to the thirdlargest
distributed denialofservice
ddos attack in history with incoming traffic reaching a peak of about terabits per second



on june github expanded its github education by offering free education bundles to all schools






acquisition by microsoft

edit

microsoft was on top of the list of the ten organizations with the most opensource contributors on github in



from
microsoft
became a significant user of github using it to host opensource projects and development tools such as
net core

chakra core

msbuild

powershell

powertoys

visual studio code

windows calculator

windows terminal
and the bulk of its product documentation now to be found on
microsoft docs







on june microsoft announced its intent to acquire github for us billion billion in the deal closed on october



github continued to operate independently as a community platform and business



under microsoft the service was led by
xamarin
s
nat friedman
reporting to
scott guthrie
executive vice president of microsoft cloud and ai
nat friedman
resigned november he was replaced by thomas dohmke



there have been concerns from developers kyle simpson
javascript
trainer and author and rafael laguna ceo at
openxchange
over microsofts purchase citing uneasiness over microsofts handling of previous acquisitions such as
nokias mobile business
and
skype







this acquisition was in line with microsofts business strategy under ceo
satya nadella
which has seen a larger focus on
cloud computing
services alongside the development of and contributions to opensource software









harvard business review
argued that microsoft was intending to acquire github to get access to its user base so it can be used as a
loss leader
to encourage the use of its other development products and services



concerns over the sale bolstered interest in competitors
bitbucket
owned by
atlassian

gitlab
and
sourceforge
owned by
slashdot
reported that they had seen spikes in new users intending to migrate projects from github to their respective services















in september github acquired
semmle
a code analysis tool



in february github launched in india under the name github india private limited



in march github announced that it was acquiring
npm
a javascript packaging vendor for an undisclosed sum of money



the deal was closed on april



in early july the github archive program was established to archive its opensource code in perpetuity



mascot

edit

githubs
mascot
is an
anthropomorphized
octocat with five
octopuslike arms







the character was created by graphic designer
simon oxley
as
clip art
to sell on
istock




a website that enables designers to market
royaltyfree
digital images
the illustration github chose was a character that oxley had named octopuss



since github wanted octopuss for their logo a use that the istock license disallows they negotiated with oxley to buy exclusive rights to the image



github renamed octopuss to octocat



and trademarked the character along with the new name



later github hired illustrator cameron mcefee to adapt octocat for different purposes on the website and promotional materials mcefee and various github users have since created hundreds of variations of the character which are available on
the octodex







services

edit

projects on github can be accessed and managed using the standard
git
commandline interface all standard git commands work with it github also allows users to browse public
repositories
on the site multiple desktop clients and git
plugins
are also available in addition the site provides
social networking
like functions such as feeds followers wikis using
wiki software
called
gollum
and a
social network graph
to display how developers work on their versions
forks
of a repository and what fork and branch within that fork is newest
anyone can browse and download public repositories but only registered users can contribute content to repositories with a registered user account users can have discussions manage repositories submit contributions to others repositories and
review changes to code
github began offering limited private repositories at no cost in january limited to three contributors per project previously only public repositories were free









on april github made all of the core github features free for everyone including private repositories with unlimited collaborators



the fundamental software that underpins github is
git
itself written by
linus torvalds
creator of linux the additional software that provides the github user interface was written using
ruby on rails
and
erlang
by github inc developers wanstrath



hyett and prestonwerner
scope

edit

the primary purpose of github is to facilitate the
version control
and
issue tracking
aspects of software development labels milestones responsibility assignment and a search engine are available for issue tracking for version control git and by extension github allows
pull requests
to propose changes to the source code users who can review the proposed changes can see a diff between the requested changes and approve them in git terminology this action is called committing and one instance of it is a commit a history of all commits is kept and can be viewed at a later time
in addition github supports the following formats and features
documentation



including automatically rendered
readme
files in a variety of
markdown
like file formats see
readme on github

wikis




with some repositories consisting solely of wiki content these include curated lists of recommended software which have become known as awesome lists






github codespaces an
online ide

visualization of
geospatial
data
d render files can be previewed using an integrated stl file viewer that displays the files on a d canvas



the viewer is powered by
webgl
and
threejs

support for previewing many common image formats including photoshops psd files
pdf document viewer
security alerts of known
common vulnerabilities and exposures
in different packages
githubs terms of service do not require public software projects hosted on github to meet the
open source definition
the
terms of service
state by setting your repositories to be viewed publicly you agree to allow others to view and fork your repositories



github enterprise

edit

github enterprise is a selfmanaged version of github with similar functionality it can be run on an organizations hardware or a cloud provider and has been available as of november




in november source code for github enterprise server was leaked online in an apparent protest against dmca takedown of
youtubedl
according to github the source code came from github accidentally sharing the code with enterprise customers themselves not from an attack on github servers






github pages

edit

in github introduced github pages a
static
web hosting service
for
blogs
project documentation






and books



all github pages content is stored in a git repository as files served to visitors verbatim or in
markdown
format github is integrated with
jekyll
static website and blog generator and github continuous integration pipelines each time the content source is updated jekyll regenerates the website and automatically serves it via github pages infrastructure



like the rest of github it includes free and paid service tiers websites generated through this service are hosted either as
subdomains
of the githubio domain or can be connected to custom
domains
bought through a thirdparty
domain name registrar




github pages supports https encryption






github actions

edit

github actions was officially launched on november it was first announced in october at github universe as a way to automate workflows but the full general availability ga release came a year later in github actions



which allows building
continuous integration
and
continuous deployment
pipelines for testing releasing and deploying software without the use of thirdparty websitesplatforms unlike many other cicd tools github actions launched with a marketplace where developers could share and reuse prebuilt actions eg testing linting deployments github wanted to reduce reliance on thirdparty services and keep developers within the github ecosystem github actions provided hosted runners linux windows macos that could dynamically scale eliminating the need for selfmanaged build servers
gist

edit

github also operates a
pastebin
style site called
gist
which is for
code snippets
as opposed to github proper which is usually used for larger projects



tom prestonwerner dbuted the feature at a ruby conference in



gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a
pastebin
by adding version control for code snippets easy forking and
tls encryption
for private pastes because each gist is its own git repository multiple code snippets can be contained in a single page and they can be pushed and pulled using git



unregistered users could upload gists until march when uploading gists was restricted to loggedin users reportedly to mitigate
spamming
on the page of recent gists



gists
urls
use hexadecimal ids and edits to gists are recorded in a
revision history
which can show the text difference of thirty revisions per page with an option between a split and unified view like repositories gists can be forked starred ie publicly bookmarked and commented on the count of revisions stars and forks is indicated on the gist page



education program

edit

github launched a new program called the github student developer pack to give students free access to more than a dozen popular development tools and services github partnered with
bitnami

crowdflower

digitalocean
dnsimple
hackhands

namecheap
orchestrate screenhero
sendgrid

stripe

travis ci
and
unreal engine
to launch the program



in github announced the launch of the github campus experts program



to train and encourage students to grow technology communities at their universities the campus experts program is open to university students years and older worldwide



github campus experts are one of the primary ways that github funds studentoriented events and communities campus experts are given access to training funding and additional resources to run events and grow their communities to become a campus expert applicants must complete an online training course with multiple modules to develop community leadership skills
github marketplace service

edit

github also provides some
software as a service
saas integrations for adding extra features to projects those services include
waffleio project management for software teams which allows users to automatically see pull requests automated builds reviews and deployments across repositories



rollbar provides realtime debugging tools and fullstack exception reporting






codebeat automated code analysis for web and mobile developers

github sponsors

edit

github sponsors allows users to make monthly money donations to projects hosted on github



the public beta was announced on may and the project accepts waitlist registrations
the verge
said that github sponsors works exactly like
patreon
because developers can offer various funding tiers that come with different perks and theyll receive recurring payments from supporters who want to access them and encourage their work except with zero fees to use the program furthermore github offers incentives for early adopters during the first year it pledges to cover payment processing costs and match sponsorship payments up to per developer furthermore users can still use similar services like patreon and open collective and link to their websites






github archive program

edit

main article
github archive program
in july github stored a february archive of the site



in an abandoned mountain mine in
svalbard
norway part of the
arctic world archive
and not far from the
svalbard global seed vault
the archive contained the code of all active public repositories as well as that of dormant but significant public repositories the
tb
of data was stored on
piqlfilm
archival film reels as
matrix d barcode

boxing barcode
and is expected to last years












the github archive program is also working with partners on project silica in an attempt to store all public repositories for years it aims to write archives into the molecular structure of
quartz glass
platters using a highprecision
petahertz
pulse laser ie one that pulses a
quadrillion
times per second

harassment allegations

edit

in march github programmer julie ann horvath alleged that founder and ceo tom prestonwerner and his wife theresa engaged in a pattern of
harassment
against her that led to her leaving the company



in april github released a statement denying horvaths allegations









however following an internal investigation github confirmed the claims githubs ceo chris wanstrath wrote on the company blog the investigation found tom prestonwerner in his capacity as githubs ceo acted inappropriately including confrontational conduct disregard of workplace complaints insensitivity to the impact of his spouses presence in the workplace and failure to enforce an agreement that his spouse should not work in the office



prestonwerner subsequently resigned from the company



the firm then announced it would implement new initiatives and trainings to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with appropriately



sanctions

edit

on july a developer based in iran wrote on
medium
that github had blocked his private repositories and prohibited access to github pages



soon after github confirmed that it was now blocking developers in
iran

crimea

cuba

north korea
and
syria
from accessing private repositories



however github reopened access to github pages days later for public repositories regardless of location it was also revealed that using github while visiting sanctioned countries could result in similar actions occurring on a users account github responded to complaints and the media through a spokesperson saying
github is subject to us trade control laws and is committed to full compliance with applicable law at the same time githubs vision is to be the global platform for
developer
collaboration no matter where developers reside as a result we take seriously our responsibility to examine government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond what is required by law this includes keeping public repositories services including those for open source projects available and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions






developers who feel that they should not have restrictions can appeal for the removal of said restrictions including those who only travel to and do not reside in those countries github has forbidden the use of
vpns
and
ip proxies
to access the site from sanctioned countries as purchase history and ip addresses are how they flag users among other sources



censorship

edit

main article
censorship of github
on december russia blacklisted githubcom because github initially refused to take down userposted suicide manuals



after a day russia withdrew its block



and github began blocking specific content and pages in russia



on december india blocked githubcom along with other websites over pro
isis
content posted by users



the block was lifted three days later



on october turkey blocked github to prevent email leakage of a hacked account belonging to the countrys energy minister



on march a largescale
ddos
attack was launched against githubcom that lasted for just under five days



the attack which appeared to originate from china primarily targeted githubhosted user content describing methods of
circumventing internet censorship










on april chinese police detained chen mei and cai wei volunteers for terminus a project hosted on github and accused them of picking quarrels and provoking trouble cai and chen archived news articles interviews and other materials published on chinese media outlets and social media platforms that have been removed by censors in china



ice contract

edit

see also
microsoft and unions united states
github has a contract with
us immigration and customs enforcement
ice for the use of their onsite product github enterprise server this contract was renewed in despite internal opposition from many github employees in an email sent to employees later posted to the github blog on october ceo
nat friedman
stated the revenue from the purchase is less than and not financially material for our company he announced that github had pledged to donate to nonprofit groups supporting immigrant communities targeted by
the current administration




in response at least github employees signed an open letter restating their opposition to the contract and denouncing alleged human rights abuses by ice as of november

five workers had resigned over the contract









the ice contract dispute came into focus again in june due to the companys decision
to abandon masterslave branch terminology
spurred by the george floyd protests and
black lives matter
movement



detractors of github describe the branch renaming to be a form of
performative activism
and have urged github to cancel their ice contract instead



an open letter from members of the open source community was shared on github in december demanding that the company drop its contract with ice and provide more transparency into how they conduct business and partnerships the letter has been signed by more than people



capitol riot comments and employee firing

edit

in january github fired one of its employees after he expressed concern for colleagues following the
january united states capitol attack
calling some of the rioters
nazis




after an investigation githubs coo said there were significant errors of judgment and procedure with the companys decision to fire the employee as a result of the investigation github reached out to the employee and the companys head of human resources resigned






twitter source code leak

edit

in parts of the social media platform
twitter
were uploaded onto github the leak was first reported by the
new york times
and was part of a legal filing twitter submitted to the
united states district court for the northern district of california
twitter claimed that the postings infringed on copyright property owned by them and asked the court for information to identify the user who posted the source code to github under the username freespeechenthusiast



reception

edit

in
linus torvalds
the original developer of git highly praised github stating the hosting of github
sic
is excellent theyve done a good job on that i think github should be commended enormously for making open source project hosting so easy however he also sharply criticized the implementation of githubs merging interface saying git comes with a nice pullrequest generation module but github instead decided to replace it with their own totally inferior version as a result i consider github useless for these kinds of things its fine for hosting but the pull requests and the online commit editing are just pure garbage
